Create maven project with cucumber and Rest Assured Dependencies
Cucumber Java, Cucumber JUnit - for test runner
Jackson(jackson-databind) - for serialization
"AddPlaceAPI" - Parameterised for reusability and using regex
Using restassured.specification.RequestSpecification and restassured.specification.ResponseSpecification for ????
Use requestspecification to build all common request; baseUri, headers, etc
Implement smart Step Definitions with reusable codes
Build Utils file to define all reusable request and response specifications
Build Pojo classes for serialization and deserializing Json Payload (TestDataBuild)
Implement logging for request and response details using RequestLoggingFilter ; crucial for debugging issues, errors (logging.txt)
Develop End to End Functionalities Tests
Define Global properties and drive all global variables from properties file
Define Enum class with constants to centralize all resources details APIResources (Enum is a special class which has collection of constants or methods)
Implement Data driven mechanism to drive data dynamically from features file(cucumber example keyword with Scenario Outline)
Implement Parameterization to run tests with multiple data sets using (Add other tests to Examples)
Add more tests and implement tagging mechanism to run selected tests from runner file (By Adding Delete Place Without writing any code) Coded only @Given("DeletePlace Payload") in stepDefinition
tags to run can be specified as part of @CucumberOptions parameters (would only run the tests with the tags)
The returned delete body can be formatted to string using freeformatter.com -> JSON string escape and place in TestDataBuild

Implement pre and postconditions for tests with Cucumber Hooks

Running tests
---------------
Manually by right clicking on TestRunner(cucumber.Options) and click Run

Execute Complete Framework from Maven commands:
mvn test  //runs all tests

Note: Running with tags, I am able to run this successfully on my OS command line but not in Intellij cmd
<projectDir>>mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @DeletePlace"    //Deprecated
<projectDir>>mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@DeletePlace"     //New running options as the above is now deprecated

Implement Maven driven global values into Test for dynamic execution

Reporting:
-----------
Add plugin net.masterthought to pom and customize to your directory and
sync with Testrunner parameter; plugin=<generated json report>
Generate Reports for Test Execution results
execute >mvn test verify (will execute all tests and the verify phase will generate test reports)
html report is generated in target/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html
